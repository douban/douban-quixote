Multi-Threaded Quixote Applications
===================================

Starting with Quixote 0.6, it's possible to write multi-threaded Quixote
applications.  In previous versions, Quixote stored the current
HTTPRequest object in a global variable, meaning that processing
multiple requests in the same process simultaneously was impossible.

However, the Publisher class as shipped still can't handle multiple
simultaneous requests; you'll need to subclass Publisher to make it
re-entrant.  Here's a starting point::

  import thread
  from quixote.publish import Publisher

  [...]

  class ThreadedPublisher (Publisher):
      def __init__ (self, root_namespace, config=None):
          Publisher.__init__(self, root_namespace, config)
          self._request_dict = {}

      def _set_request(self, request):
          self._request_dict[thread.get_ident()] = request

      def _clear_request(self):
          try:
              del self._request_dict[thread.get_ident()]
          except KeyError:
              pass

      def get_request(self):
          return self._request_dict.get(thread.get_ident())

Using ThreadedPublisher, you now have one current request per thread,
rather than one for the entire process.
