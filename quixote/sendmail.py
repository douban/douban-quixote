    In RFC 822, a "mailbox" is either a bare e-mail address or a bare
    e-mail address coupled with a chunk of text, most often someone's
    name.  Eg. the following are all "mailboxes" in the RFC 822 grammar:
      luser@example.com
      Joe Luser <luser@example.com>
      Paddy O'Reilly <paddy@example.ie>
      "Smith, John" <smith@example.com>
      Dick & Jane <dickjane@example.net>
      "Tom, Dick, & Harry" <tdh@example.org>

    This class represents an (addr_spec, real_name) pair and takes care
    of quoting the real_name according to RFC 822's rules for you.
    Just use the format() method and it will spit out a properly-
    quoted RFC 822 "mailbox".

                config : quixote.config.Config = (current publisher's config)):

    Send an email message to a list of recipients via a local SMTP
    server.  In normal use, you supply a list of primary recipient
    e-mail addresses in 'to_addrs', an optional list of secondary
    recipient addresses in 'cc_addrs', and a sender address in
    'from_addr'.  sendmail() then constructs a message using those
    addresses, 'subject', and 'msg_body', and mails the message to every
    recipient address.  (Specifically, it connects to the mail server
    named in the MAIL_SERVER config variable -- default "localhost" --
    and instructs the server to send the message to every recipient
    address in 'to_addrs' and 'cc_addrs'.)

    'from_addr' is optional because web applications often have a common
    e-mail sender address, such as "webmaster@example.com".  Just set
    the Quixote config variable MAIL_FROM, and it will be used as the
    default sender (both header and envelope) for all e-mail sent by
    sendmail().

    E-mail addresses can be specified a number of ways.  The most
    efficient is to supply instances of RFC822Mailbox, which bundles a
    bare e-mail address (aka "addr_spec" from the RFC 822 grammar) and
    real name together in a readily-formattable object.  You can also
    supply an (addr_spec, real_name) tuple, or an addr_spec on its own.
    The latter two are converted into RFC822Mailbox objects for
    formatting, which is why it may be more efficient to construct
    RFC822Mailbox objects yourself.

    Thus, the following are all equivalent in terms of who gets the
    message:
      sendmail(to_addrs=["joe@example.com"], ...)
      sendmail(to_addrs=[("joe@example.com", "Joe User")], ...)
      sendmail(to_addrs=[RFC822Mailbox("joe@example.com", "Joe User")], ...)
    ...although the "To" header will be slightly different.  In the
    first case, it will be
      To: joe@example.com
    while in the other two, it will be:
      To: Joe User <joe@example.com>
    which is a little more user-friendly.

    In more advanced usage, you might wish to specify the SMTP sender
    and recipient addresses separately.  For example, if you want your
    application to send mail to users that looks like it comes from a
    real human being, but you don't want that human being to get the
    bounce messages from the mailing, you might do this:
      sendmail(to_addrs=user_list,
               ...,
               from_addr=("realuser@example.com", "A Real User"),
               smtp_sender="postmaster@example.com")

    End users will see mail from "A Real User <realuser@example.com>" in
    their inbox, but bounces will go to postmaster@example.com.

    One use of different header and envelope recipients is for
    testing/debugging.  If you want to test that your application is
    sending the right mail to bigboss@example.com without filling
    bigboss' inbox with dross, you might do this:
      sendmail(to_addrs=["bigboss@example.com"],
               ...,
               smtp_recipients=["developers@example.com"])

    This is so useful that it's a Quixote configuration option: just set
    MAIL_DEBUG_ADDR to (eg.) "developers@example.com", and every message
    that sendmail() would send out is diverted to the debug address.

    Generally raises an exception on any SMTP errors; see smtplib (in
    the standard library documentation) for details.
