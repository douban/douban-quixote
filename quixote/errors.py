    """PublishError exceptions are raised due to some problem with the
    data provided by the client and are raised during the publishing
    process.  Quixote will abort the current request and return an error
    page to the client.

    public_msg should be a user-readable message that reveals no
    inner workings of your application; it will always be shown.

    private_msg will only be shown if the config option SECURE_ERRORS is
    false; Quixote uses this to give you more detail about why the error
    occurred.  You might want to use it for similar, application-specific
    information.  (SECURE_ERRORS should always be true in a production
    environment, since these details about the inner workings of your
    application could conceivably be useful to attackers.)

    The formatting done by the Quixote versions of these exceptions is
    very simple.  Applications will probably wish to raise application
    specific subclasses which do more sophisticated formatting or provide
    a _q_except handler to format the exception.
